# BRTOS with uNet for Cooja environment (unet4cooja)

This project is intended to analyses the performance of uNet network protocol in the Cooja WSN simulator.

# BRTOS
"BRTOS is a lightweight preemptive real time operating system designed for low end microcontrollers."
"BRTOS kernel is written mostly in C language, with little assembly code in the HAL file (Hardware Abstraction Layer)."

# uNet
Is a lightweight protocol implemented for Wireless Sensor Nertworks with resource constrained devices. This protocol implements peer-to-peer acknowledge methods to improve the reliability in environments that are highly affected by interference.

# Contiki
"Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized low-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.
Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-commercial systems, such as city sound monitoring, street lights, networked electrical power meters, industrial monitoring, radiation monitoring, construction site monitoring, alarm systems, remote house monitoring, and so on.
For more information, see the Contiki website:

# Cooja
"Cooja is the Contiki network simulator. Cooja allows large and small networks of Contiki motes to be simulated. Motes can be emulated at the hardware level, which is slower but allows precise inspection of the system behavior, or at a less detailed level, which is faster and allows simulation of larger networks."
